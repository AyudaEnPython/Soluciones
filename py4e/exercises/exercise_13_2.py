"""
Extracting Data from XML

In this assignment you will write a Python program somewhat similar to
http://www.py4e.com/code3/json2.py. The program will prompt for a URL,
read the JSON data from that URL using urllib and then parse and
extract the comment counts from the JSON data, compute the sum of the
numbers in the file and enter the sum below:

We provide two files for this assignment. One is a sample file where we
give you the sum for your testing and the other is the actual data you
need to process for the assignment.
    - Sample data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json
        (Sum=2553)
    - Actual data: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_18423.json
        (Sum ends with 58)

You do not need to save these files to your folder since your program
will read the data directly from the URL. Note: Each student will have
a distinct data url for the assignment - so only use your own data url
for analysis.

Data Format

The data consists of a number of names and comment counts in JSON as
follows:

    +-------------------------------+
    | {                             |
    |     comments: [               |
    |         {                     |
    |             name: "Matthias"  |
    |             count: 97         |
    |         },                    |
    |         {                     |
    |             name: "Geomer"    |
    |             count: 97         |
    |         }                     |
    |         ...                   |
    |     ]                         |
    | }                             |
    +-------------------------------+

The closest sample code that shows how to parse JSON and extract a list
is json2.py. You might also want to look at geoxml.py to see how to
prompt for a URL and retrieve data from a URL.

Sample Execution

    +----------------------------------------------------------------+
    | $ python3 solution.py                                          |
    | Enter location: http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json |
    | Retrieving http://py4e-data.dr-chuck.net/comments_42.json      |
    | Retrieved 2711 characters                                      |
    | Count: 50                                                      |
    | Sum: 2...                                                      |
