# 7.15. Chapter Assessment

Write one for loop to print out each character of the string `my_str` on a
separate line.
```python
my_str = "MICHIGAN"
for c in my_str:
    print(c)
```

Write one for loop to print out each element of the list `several_things`.
Then, write another for loop to print out the TYPE of each element of the
list `several_things`. To complete this problem you should have written two
different for loops, each of which iterates over the list `several_things`,
but each of those 2 for loops should have a different result.
```python
my_str = "MICHIGAN"
several_things = ["hello", 2, 4, 6.0, 7.5, 234352354, "the end", "", 99]
for things in several_things:
    print(things)
for things in several_things:
    print(type(things))
```

Write code that uses iteration to print out **the length** of each element of
the list stored in str_list.
```python
str_list = ["hello", "", "goodbye", "wonderful", "I love Python"]

# Write your code here.
for s in str_list:
    print(len(s))
```

Write a program that uses the turtle module **and** a for loop to draw something.
It doesnâ€™t have to be complicated, but draw something different than we have
done in the past. (Hint: if you are drawing something complicated, it could
get tedious to watch it draw over and over. Try setting `.speed(10)` for the
turtle to draw fast, or `.speed(0)` for it to draw super fast with no
animation.)
```python
import turtle

t = turtle.Turtle()
x, n = 50, 6
# for _ in range(n):
#    t.fd(x)
#    t.lt(360/n)
[(t.fd(x), t.lt(360/n)) for _ in range(n)]
```

Write code to count the number of characters in `original_str` using the
accumulation pattern and assign the answer to a variable `num_chars`. Do NOT use
the `len` function to solve the problem (if you use it while you are working on
this problem, comment it out afterward!)
```python
original_str = "The quick brown rhino jumped over the extremely lazy fox."
num_chars = sum(1 for c in original_str)
```

`addition_str` is a string with a list of numbers separated by the `+` sign.
Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to take the sum of all of the
numbers and assigns it to `sum_val` (an integer). (You should use the `.split("+")`
function to split by `"+"` and `int()` to cast to an integer).
```python
addition_str = "2+5+10+20"
sum_val = sum(map(int, addition_str.split("+")))
```

`week_temps_f` is a string with a list of fahrenheit temperatures separated by
the `,` sign. Write code that uses the accumulation pattern to compute the average
(sum divided by number of items) and assigns it to `avg_temp`. Do not hard code
your answer (i.e., make your code compute both the sum or the number of items in
`week_temps_f`) (You should use the `.split(",")` function to split by `","` and
`float()` to cast to a float).
```python
week_temps_f = "75.1,77.7,83.2,82.5,81.0,79.5,85.7"
ts = [float(t) for t in week_temps_f.split(",")]
avg_temp = sum(ts)/len(ts)
```

Write code to create a list of numbers from 0 to 67 and assign that list to the
variable `nums`. Do not hard code the list.
```python
nums = [x for x in range(68)]
```
