# 2.18. Chapter Assessment

There is a function we are providing in for you in this problem called `square`.
It takes one integer and returns the square of that integer value. Write code
to assign a variable called `xyz` the value `5*5` (five squared). Use the square
function, rather than just multiplying with `*`.
```python
xyz = ""
xyz = square(5)
```

Write code to assign the number of characters in the string `rv` to a variable
`num_chars`.
```python
rv = """Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
    Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore,
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
    As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
    'Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door;
    Only this and nothing more."""

# Write your code here!
num_chars = len(rv)
```
