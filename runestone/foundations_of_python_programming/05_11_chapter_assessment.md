# 5.11. Chapter Assessment - Turtle and Object Mechanics

What are correct ways to tell a turtle named Tex to move forward 20 pixels?
Select as many as apply.

- [X] A. Tex.forward(20)
- [ ] B. forward() + 20
- [ ] C. forward(20)
- [ ] D. forward(20).Tex
- [X] E. Tex.forward(10 + 10)

        A. This is a correct way to move turtle forward.
        E. You are allowed to write expressions inside methods, so this is correctly written.

Which is the correct way to make a new instance of the Turtle class?

- [ ] A. turtle(Turtle)
- [X] B. turtle.Turtle()
- [ ] C. Turtle.turtle()
- [ ] D. Turtle(turtle)

        Yes, this is the correct way.

What does each instance of the Turtle class represent?

- [] A. The turtle class.
- [] B. The same turtle that is used in each drawing your programs make.
- [X] C. A unique 'turtle' that you can use to draw.

        Yes, an instance of the turtle class represents a unique turtle. The
        turtle class is like a stencil or mold that can be used to make as
        many turtles as you would like.

Select all of the following things that methods can do:

- [X] A. Change the value of an attribute.
- [X] B. Return values.
- [X] C. Create new attributes of an instance and set their values.
- [ ] D. Delete object instances.
- [ ] E. None of the above.

        A. Methods can change the value that is associated with an attribute.
        B. Methods can return values.
        C. Attributes do not need to be pre-declared; any code can add a new
        attribute to an instance just by assigning a value to it.
