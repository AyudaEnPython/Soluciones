# 15.7. Chapter Assessment

Create a function called `mult` that has two parameters, the first is required
and should be an integer, the second is an optional parameter that can either
be a number or a string but whose default is 6. The function should return
the first parameter multiplied by the second.

```python
def mult(x, y=6):
    return x * y
```
