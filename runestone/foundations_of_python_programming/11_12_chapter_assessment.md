# 11.12. Chapter Assessment

At the halfway point during the Rio Olympics, the United States had 70 medals,
Great Britain had 38 medals, China had 45 medals, Russia had 30 medals, and
Germany had 17 medals. Create a dictionary assigned to the variable
`medal_count` with the country names as the keys and the number of medals the
country had as each key’s value.
```python
medal_count = {
    "United States": 70,
    "Great Britain": 38,
    "China": 45,
    "Russia": 30,
    "Germany": 17,
}
```

Given the dictionary `swimmers`, add an additional key-value pair to the dictionary
with `"Phelps"` as the key and the integer `23` as the value. Do not rewrite the
entire dictionary.
```python
swimmers = {'Manuel':4, 'Lochte':12, 'Adrian':7, 'Ledecky':5, 'Dirado':4}
swimmers["Phelps"] = 23
```

Add the string “hockey” as a key to the dictionary `sports_periods` and assign it
the value of 3. Do not rewrite the entire dictionary.
```python
sports_periods = {'baseball': 9, 'basketball': 4, 'soccer': 4, 'cricket': 2}
sports_periods["hockey"] = 3
```
