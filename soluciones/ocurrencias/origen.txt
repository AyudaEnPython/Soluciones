Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an efficient sorting algorithm.
Developed by British computer scientist Tony Hoare in 1959[1] and published in 1961,[2]
it is still a commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about
two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and heapsort.
