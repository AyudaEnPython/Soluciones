Asume s is a string of lower case characters. Write a program that
prints the longest substring of s in which the letters occur in
alphabetical order.

For example, if: s = "azcbobobegghakl", then your program should print:

    Longest substring in alphabetical order is: beggh

In the case of ties, print the first substring. For example, if:
s = "abcbcd", then your program should print:

    Longest substring in alphabetical order is: abc

TODO: make some minor changes.
